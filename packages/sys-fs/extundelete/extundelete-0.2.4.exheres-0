SUMMARY="Extundelete is a utility to undelete files from an ext3 or ext4 partition"
DESCRIPTION="extundelete is a utility that can recover deleted files from an ext3 or ext4 partition.
The ext3 file system is the most common file system when using Linux, and ext4 is its successor.
extundelete uses the information stored in the partition's journal to attempt to recover a file that
has been deleted from the partition. There is no guarantee that any particular file will be able to
be undeleted, so always try to have a good backup system in place, or at least put one in place
after recovering your files!"
